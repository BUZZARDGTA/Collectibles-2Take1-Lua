# PROJECT ARCHIVED / FAREWELL

On September 17, 2024, R* added the [BattleEye Anti-Cheat](https://www.battleye.com/) to GTA Online, meaning I can no longer work on this or any of my other scripts. All of my 2Take1 Mod Menu scripts will now be archived.

It's been a blast-fun, rewarding, and full of good vibes-to learn scripting for GTA 5, making my own stuff. But, yeah, it was never exactly allowed, and all good things must come to an end.

Thanks to everyone who supported my work, whether up close or from a distance. It really kept me motivated.

If you were into my GTA scripts, you might be interested in a project I'm still working on: [GTA-V-Session-Sniffer](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/GTA-V-Session-Sniffer).

- [root-cause/v-decompiled-scripts](https://github.com/root-cause/v-decompiled-scripts) - Where I reverse-engineer almost everything that I couldn't find elsewhere.
- [www.rockstargames.com/gta-v](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v) - In September 2022, the GTA V source code was leaked, and I sometimes use it for reverse engineering.
- [YimMenu-Lua/DailyCollectibles](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/DailyCollectibles) - Sometimes, I would copy and paste their code or review how they implemented things to save time on reverse engineering.
- [YimMenu-Lua/RandomEvents](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/RandomEvents) - Helped with debugging by force-starting some random events.
- [@DurtyFree](https://github.com/DurtyFree) - Taught me where to find the accurate list of all multiplayer stats.
- [@doctorflexochan](https://github.com/doctorflexochan) - Provided me with the "Unique Stunt Jump" stat name before @DurtyFree taught me...

- [GTALens.com Maps](https://gtalens.com/map) - The owner is really nice and updated the website on my requests. They often provided me with locations whenever I couldn't find them through reverse engineering by myself:
